✔ Approach> 
   I utilize Sql server for conducting various queries, Power-Bi for data visualisation and powerpoint for 
   engaging presentation with these tools I discovered key insights and recommendations to derive future actions 
   by the stakeholders.

✔ Key findings:-

✔ Stamp_Registration_Analysis:-
✔ Total Registered Documents revenue is 295 billion and total e-stamp revenue is 221 billion.
✔ Rangareddy,Medchal_Malkajgiri,Hyderabad,Sangareddy,Hanumakonda are the top 5 districts with the most document 
   registration revenue.
   
✔ Rangareddy,Hyderabad,Hanumakonda,Yadavri Bhuvanagiri and Khamman are the districts in Telanagana having more E-stamp
   revenue as compared to the Document Registration Revenue.
   
✔ E-Stamp challans was introduced in the year 2020 after the implementation of e-stamps,there came a bit decrement in   the number of document registrations in FY2021 AND FY2022 so this metric depicts an alteration in the count pattern.

✔ Transportation_Segment:-
✔ We have different categories of vehicles as per the fuel type we have Petrol,Electric,Diesel and others so in this 
  category we have the maximum sales related to the petrol based vehicles.
  
✔ The Vehicle indistry has seen some definite seasonel trends with peak demands occuring in June and October and
   November and lowest sales in April and May.In Telangana vehicle dealers often experience difficulty selling 
   inventory during the summer months when consumers are less motivated to make a vehicle purchase.
   
✔ With respect to a specific vehicle preference i.e Motorcycles Hyderabad,Medchal_Makajgiri and Rangareddy
  are the 3 districts having the most sales with respect to Motorcycles.
  
✔ With respect to the distribution of sales by seat capacity 1_to_3 seater segment has got the most sales
   then 4_to_6 seater and 6_seater_above.
   
✔ Distribution of sales by transport category so we have two categories here Transport and
   Non-Transport category with maximum sales in Transport category.

✔ Ts-iPass:-
✔  Total investment stands around 2.58 billion.

✔  Plastic and Rubber,Pharmaceuticals and chemicals,Real Estate Industry tools and IT buidings,Solar and Other
    Renewable energy materials,Engineering are the top 5 sectors having the most investment.
    
✔  Rangareddy,Sangareddy,Medchal_Malkajgiri are the top 3 districts having the most investments.

✔  Engineering,Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals,Plastic and Rubber are the industries that have shown substantial 
   investment in multiple districts so it indicates that there is heavy business in these sectors that is
   operating in multiple districts.

✔ Key reasons for most investments in top 3 districts are Government policies and incentives,connectivity
  and logistics and geographical location that contributes to these factors.
